  "hello": "Hello, Ksu!!",
  "about": "Kseniya is a Germany-based tonmeister and recording producer. She holds a diploma with honors in Sound Engineering from Belarusian State Academy of Arts in Minsk, and a Master of Music Sound Recording from McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Kseniya did internships in Polish Radio, Banff Centre of Arts in Creativity, and BR Klassik. Already during her first studies, she started to work part-time in Belarusian State Musical Theatre as a sound engineer, where she was responsible for musicals, operas and ballet live sound and sound productions not only in Minsk but during work trips in various halls in Germany, China, and Russia. At the same time, she worked as a freelancer with different musical ensembles, such as Orchestra Olympia Classic and Capella Sonorus. During her studies in Canada, she held positions of Live Sound Coordinator and Research Assistant for Music Production class. Kseniya has a reasonable amount of mixing and production experience, including webcasts. Among significant projects mixed live are Bernstein Candide, Orff Carmina Burana and Mahler 5. Her chamber music productions were broadcasted by CBC Radio Canada and BBC London. To stay connected with European recording tradition Kseniya made a decision to do another master degree in German with the focus of classical music in Erich-Tiehnhaus Institute in Detmold, the origin of tonmeister art. Unique cultural and professional experience builds piece by piece Kseniyaâ€™ s music recording aesthetics, which continues to develop every day. Learning from the best mentors, recording wonderful musicians, being able to experience outstanding halls all around the world, together with a natural love for music shape a professional goal: to be able to help musicians to create a telling performance supported by delicious sound.",
  "immersive_1": "Immersive recording and playback technologies can now reproduce the full character of sound in all spatial dimensions, allowing for the creation of a more natural reality related sound stage. For binaural and  multichannel mixing, space is a very important component: the acoustics is a crucial part of outstanding interpretations: better balance, timbre mixing, audibility, and tonal envelopment involve the listener more emotionally and contribute to the understanding of musical structures. In the conventional stereo image, a large proportion of diffuse sound often leads to a loss of details and the sound becomes blurred. Immersive audio formats, however, allow us to transmit acoustic details in high spatial resolution without losing clarity.",
  "immersive_2": "Facilities in McGill University allowed Kseniya to make an immersive audio one of the main focuses of her studies. She did a lot of productions in 3D, especially in classical music. Her experience includes mixing in such formats as Auro-3D, Ambisonics and Dolby Atmos."
